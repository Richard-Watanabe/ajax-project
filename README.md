# My Ghibli Movie Review

A web application that lets Studio Ghibli fans review all and any Ghibli film! It includes a completion counter for the 21 Ghibli films and will let you know how many more Ghibli films you have to write a review to complete all the films. It pulls Studio Ghibli information from the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) and pulls the movie posters from the [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

I chose to build this project because I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan myself, and when I found a public API from Studio Ghibli, I knew I wanted to use it to make my very own application. Additionally, I thought it would be convenient to have a review web-application dedicated just for Ghibli Films.
